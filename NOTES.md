Abstraction is one way that we simplify a program. We hide the behind the scenes stuff and make a program that is straightforward to use. It's like an outlet. A lot goes into an outlet to wire it and to supply it power. But you don't need to know how to manke an outlet in order to use one. You can just plug into the socket and use it. The "How" of the socket is abstracted away.
Our abstraction is different depending on the user. Many products are abstractions such as cars, laptops, cell phones, etc.
